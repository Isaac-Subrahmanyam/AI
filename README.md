# MovieReviewAIModel

-	AI model that classifies movie reviews to positive or negative weights. Turns each review into a feature vector that leverages the sparse representation. We train with a linear classifier using the hinge loss method. Uses stochastic gradient descent in order to minimize the loss function.
